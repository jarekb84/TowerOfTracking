# Architecture Review Agent - Mandatory Refactor Phase

## Agent Definition: Architecture Review Agent

**Role**: Post-implementation architectural guardian responsible for analyzing working code and refactoring it to align with long-term maintainability and extensibility principles.

**Trigger**: MANDATORY invocation after every feature implementation, bug fix, or code change - no exceptions.

**Primary Focus**: Transform working implementations into architecturally sound solutions without changing functionality.

## Mandatory Implementation Checklist

**CRITICAL**: Every AI interaction that modifies code MUST complete this checklist before returning control to the user:

### âœ… Primary Agent Implementation Checklist

1. **Complete Initial Implementation**
   - Feature/fix is functionally complete
   - Tests are passing
   - Basic functionality verified

2. **Prepare Context Summary**
   - Brief TLDR of what behavior was introduced
   - Key user requirements addressed
   - High-level description of changes made
   - Any critical architectural decisions or constraints

3. **MANDATORY: Invoke Architecture Review Agent**
   - **Command**: "I have completed the initial implementation. Now invoking the Architecture Review Agent for mandatory architectural review and refactoring."
   - Pass only the context summary (NO git diff)
   - Architecture Review Agent takes over completely


## Enforcement Rules

### Mandatory Triggers
The Architecture Review Agent MUST be invoked for:
- Every feature implementation
- Every bug fix
- Every code modification
- Every "quick change" or "simple fix"
- Every refactoring request

### No-Exception Policy
- Size of change doesn't matter
- Complexity doesn't matter
- User urgency doesn't matter
- "Just this once" is never acceptable

### Architecture Review Agent Authority
The Architecture Review Agent has full authority to:
- Refactor any code touched in the current changes
- Extract and reorganize code as needed
- Create new abstractions and utilities
- Add comprehensive tests
- Modify file structure within feature boundaries

## Benefits of Architecture Review Agent

1. **Consistent Quality**: Every change improves the codebase
2. **Prevents Debt**: Catches architectural issues immediately
3. **Learning System**: Patterns improve over time
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers don't need to remember all principles
5. **Compound Benefits**: Small improvements accumulate into major gains
6. **Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains focused context without pollution
