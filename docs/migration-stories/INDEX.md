## Common Patterns Across Stories

### Investigation Phase (Stories 7, 8, 9, 10)
Some stories require investigation first:
- Find current file locations (use Grep)
- Identify dependencies and usage
- Map import relationships
- Document findings before moving

### File Movement Process
All stories follow this pattern:
1. Create directory structure
2. Move files systematically
3. Update import statements (external first, then internal)
4. Update barrel exports (if applicable)
5. Run verification (build, tests, manual testing)

### Verification Checklist
Every story requires:
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm run test` passes
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] Manual testing of feature
- [ ] No logic or behavior changes

## File Naming Conventions

### Stories Use Consistent Naming
- `XX-feature-name-migration.md` format
- Descriptive feature names
- Analysis sub-features prefixed with `analysis-`

### Target Directories Use Feature Names
- `data-import/` not `import/`
- `analysis/` not `analytics/`
- `tier-trends/` not `trends/`

## Quick Reference: Before â†’ After

### Type-Based (Current)
```
data-tracking/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ (38 files)
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/ (27 files)
â”œâ”€â”€ logic/ (16 files)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/ (20+ files)
â””â”€â”€ types/ (10+ files)
```

### Feature-Based (Target)
```

â”œâ”€â”€ data-import/
â”œâ”€â”€ data-export/
â”œâ”€â”€ settings/
â”œâ”€â”€ game-runs/

## Getting Help

### If You're Stuck
1. Reference parent PRD for principles
2. Reference file-organization-analysis.md for examples
3. Check story-specific notes
4. Document issue in story file
5. Continue with next story if blocked

### If You Find Missing Information
1. Document discovery in story file
2. Update story with findings
3. Help future migrations
4. Consider creating addendum

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Each Story
1. Read story completely
2. Understand current state
3. Review dependencies
4. Plan time allocation
5. Ensure clean git state

### During Execution
1. Investigate thoroughly (if required)
2. Move files systematically
3. Update imports in batches
4. Test frequently
5. Document deviations

### After Completing Story
1. Run full verification
2. Manual test feature
3. Update progress checklist
4. Commit changes atomically
5. Take a break before next story

## Tips for Success

### Time Management
- Don't rush stories
- Take breaks between stories
- Small stories (1-3) are good warm-ups
- Large stories (4, 5) need focused time
- Cleanup story (10) needs thorough review

### Import Updates
- Use Grep to find all imports
- Update in batches (10-20 files at a time)
- Run tests after each batch
- Watch for circular dependencies
- Use absolute imports (`@/...`)

### Testing Strategy
- Run build after moving files
- Run tests after import updates
- Manual test after story complete
- Don't skip verification steps

## Success Indicators

### After Each Story
- âœ… Feature in new location
- âœ… Old files removed
- âœ… Imports updated
- âœ… Tests passing
- âœ… Feature works identically

### After All Stories
- âœ… Organized by feature
- âœ… Clear boundaries
- âœ… Easy navigation
- âœ… Self-documenting structure
- âœ… Developer satisfaction improved

## Final Notes

This migration is about **improving code organization**, not changing functionality. Every story should result in:
- Better discoverability
- Clearer boundaries
- Easier maintenance
- Same behavior

Remember: **Working code first, organized code second**. Don't break functionality in pursuit of perfect organization.

Good luck with your migration! ðŸš€
